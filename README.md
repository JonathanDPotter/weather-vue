# Weather Imp (Vue)
  
This app was written in TypeScript with Vue. It is a conversion of my
React [Weather Imp](https://github.com/JonathanDPotter/weather-api) project into a Vue project. I used it to learn more
about Vue, the composition API and Bootstrap.

I used Vuex for state management, Bootstrap for styling and Axios for API
calls.
The back end is written in TypeScript with Express.js and the repo can be
found [here](https://github.com/JonathanDPotter/weather-api-back)
