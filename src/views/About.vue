    <p>
      This app was written in TypeScript with Vue. It is a conversion of my
      React Weather Imp project into a Vue project. I used it to learn more
      about Vue, the composition API and Bootstrap.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used Vuex for state management, Bootstrap for styling and Axios for API
      calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back end is written in TypeScript with Express.js and the repo can be
      found
